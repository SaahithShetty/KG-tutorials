We can perform Principal Component Analysis on the entity embeddings, keeping 2 (or 3) principal components. ComplEx adds a further complication layer, as it uses complex vectors, which are in a sense already 2-dimensional. To tackle this, we will simply apply a Real-Valued Transformation by stacking the real and imaginary part of the embeddings."
